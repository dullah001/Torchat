# Torchat
TorChat is an anonymous, encrypted messenger that routes all traffic through Tor with randomized circuits. No phone numbers—just cryptographic IDs. Messages are padded, delayed, and mixed with cover traffic to protect metadata. Inspired by Signal, built for maximum privacy. (Educational, not production-ready.)
